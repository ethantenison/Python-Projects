    "### Introduction\n",
    "Climate change is one of the apparent effects of the rapid economic growth that has occurred in most countries\n",
    "since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century. It is an important issue for economic\n",
    "policymaking, since governments need to assess how serious the problem is and then decide how to\n",
    "mitigate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you on a policy advisory team for a nation. The government would like to know more about the\n",
    "extent of climate change and its possible causes, before they make decisions on how to mitigate its\n",
    "probable economic and social impacts, and whether or not to actively participate in internationally\n",
    "coordinated collective efforts to reduce global impacts.\n",
    "I would like you to select a (real!) grateful nation to receive your policy advice. Please determine the\n",
    "capital city of this country, and then find its geographic location (latitude and longitude).\n",
    " You are generally being asked to examine the following questions from the perspective of your specific\n",
    "country:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How can we tell whether climate change will actually affect our nation?\n",
    "2. If it is real, how can we measure the extent of climate change and determine what is causing it?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the first question, you will analyze the behavior of environmental variables over time to see\n",
    "whether there are general patterns in environmental conditions that could be indicative of climate\n",
    "change. You will focus on temperature-related variables.\n",
    "To answer the second question, you will examine the degree of association between temperature and\n",
    "another variable, CO2 emissions, and consider whether there is a plausible relationship between the\n",
    "two, or whether there are other explanations for what you observe.\n",
    "You will do your analysis, plots, and write up, then submit your results in the form of a Jupyter\n",
    "notebook, making use of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, as well as Numpy, statsmodels, or any other\n",
    "Python ecosystem packages you think useful. \n"
